# Cypress features

This directory is home to all Cypress `.feature` files. Each feature should focus on a suite of scenarios for testing - but not for testing specific components. All step definitions for these features go in the `step_definitions` directory. Where possible, step definitions should be as generic and re-usable as possible.
